      <p>Inspirational figures have appeared at different points in my life and often not while holding “important” managerial positions, but sometimes just in small everyday routine scenarios. Leaders don’t necessarily have to be a boss at work, a senior officer in the army, or even in a captain of a sports team; these are all places where there’s an expectation of them already and in a way almost means they’re held to higher standards. Leadership is not a choice someone makes (“today I’m am going to lead”) or something that can just be granted to someone (“congrats today you are promoted to manager and therefore a leader”). Leadership is inherent in someone’s nature and personality. This can be developed and nurtured either through systematic, deliberate coaching, or through self-discovery from life experience. </p>
<p>The leaders I remember the most in my life have usually emerged in places where there’s either been an immediate requirement for someone to step up in that moment and they deliver an awesome response in the situation faced, or that someone went above and beyond all expectations and surprised me with their empathy, generosity and genuine care – both for the people involved and / or the situation itself. Examples of these situations could be a colleague who steps forward to defend you when facing a barrage of shit from a detached boss or rude client and then picks you up and keeps you motivated. Or, it could be a friend who sees an injustice occur in the street and has the moral courage to intervene rather than walk by. This may instantly command your respect for they have done something that most others would not because of the values and standards they uphold in themselves and expect from others. </p>
<p>Respect is most certainly a core feeling you must have towards a person for them to inspire you as a leader, but this alone is not enough. You also need to trust them. Trust isn’t easily gained but is very easily lost. An example of this for me was in a job where I had a boss who I trusted completely for years and who I thought always had my best interests at heart. That trust was then eroded over a period of around 6-8 months through numerous failures in leadership and missed chances to rectify the wrongs. Once that trust had been lost and I felt he didn’t have any integrity or moral courage to do what was right, it was an impossible relationship to repair. At that point, not only had the trust left the relationship but, due repercussions on the wider team, so had my respect and previously unwavering obedience to follow him. That situation was made more difficult because he was also in a position of management, so I was left with a manager who no longer motivated or inspired and that made the environment very difficult for the both of us. </p>
<p>The silver lining? Well, where there is poor leadership, there are lessons to be learnt – how not to lead. When reflecting on the situation above as various stages unfolded, I thought about what a good leader would have done differently and identified two key aspects. The first was his failure to consider the effect his actions (or lack of) would have on his team. This, I realised, was due to a lack of empathy. A good leader would have foreseen the potential impact of the situation on the people who look up to him and would have done everything in his power to protect them. His second failure was then to not have the difficult conversations afterwards that could have potentially rectified the wrongs that had been done. This was due to a lack of moral courage. A good leader would have had the moral courage to take a stand and tell his superiors that what was happening to his team was wrong and that he was going to fight for what was right. Even if he failed, his team would have rallied behind him and their trust in him to do his best to protect them would have remained. </p>
<p>Another couple of good examples of poor leadership I have witnessed in the workplace was when a young and ambitious employee had their first year-end review meeting with a board member of a business following a very good year at the firm. During the meeting, the employee told the board member that he had aspirations to become a manager in two years and a director in ten. The board member who was texting on his phone throughout the meeting looked up and said with an awkward smile “well, that will be challenging”. </p>
<p>In four words he had blown the wind out of the sails out of a hungry, hard-working employee. Clearly, this board member was too busy on his phone to think about an appropriate response. If he had been concentrating, perhaps he may have realised that in any situation – and no matter how he felt about the employee or whether he thought his ambition was achievable or not – the right way to have responded to the sentiment shown would have been with encouragement. In four words he instantly lost the respect of an intelligent and motivated employee and gained a reputation as a weak leader amongst the employee’s peer group who were all astounded to hear about the experience. A strong leader would have said something along the lines of “that’s a great ambition, keep working hard and I’m sure you’ll get there”, even if he didn’t believe it. Because good leaders inspire and motivate. Another lesson learned on how not lead. </p>
<p>I really believe that it is so important to have strong leaders in your life who you can look up to and turn to in times of uncertainty or doubt. That’s why I have a lot of respect for people who have been fortunate to have good leaders in their lives and decide to give back to younger people through mentoring and advice. However, although most people tend to think of leaders as people who are older than them, some of the greatest examples of leadership I have seen have come from people younger than me. </p>
<p>An example of this might be a younger sibling who shows courage in the face of adversity (such as a bereavement or other life-changing incident) and who manages to hold a family together through the most traumatic of times. Or, a child who holds a high level of integrity and moral standards and which you look to with admiration as a measure against your own. </p>
<p>A scenario I can always relate to is in the playground with a sports captain who doubles up as a school bully. As she is a sports captain, she assumes she has a right to enforce her tyranny and seeks to humiliate or intimidate anyone who might dare to have thoughts of challenging her. She is also publicly rude to people too as she believes this will assert her authority as a strong leader who is not to be challenged. I think we’ve all encountered a bully like this before, either at work or socially. </p>
<p>Who do the other children in the school build lasting friendships with in the end? Not the bully. When you think back to those characters who fit the personality of the bully – where are they now? The child who is fondly remembered for years to come is the child who takes a stand or keeps getting up when they get knocked down. Some will follow the leader out of fear. These are usually weak children who are easily manipulated and prefer to be sheep than shepherds. Their loyalty isn’t unwavering, it’s just to whoever they fear the most at that time. </p>
<p>Eventually the tyranny ends and when it does no one is there to help them. Managing people through fear is almost always an indication of self-doubt and insecurities. It’s a weakness. It’s desperation to be listened to. <u>This is not leadership</u>. </p>
<p>In the school playground, this can have a lasting effect on the children and it’s the up to “leaders” within the school to have the proactiveness to find out that it is occurring and then the courage to do something about it, just like in the workplace where bad managers should either be re-trained or removed. Their toxic influence kills morale and destroys confidence. <i>Right here I’d just like to drop a quote from Frederick Douglass which really hits home how I feel about protecting and inspiring children: it is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.</i> In the workplace, however, this kind of bullying behaviour and lack of courage from other managers to take a stand results in a stressful environment, unhappy and demotivated employees, and overall lower productivity. A study by Harvard University found that hiring one highly productive ‘toxic worker’ does more damage to a company’s bottom line than employing several less productive, but more cooperative, workers. Sometimes referred to in the military as “addition through subtraction”. Getting rid of the biggest pain in the ass made life better for everyone. </p>
<p>The book <i> Legacy </i> by <i> James Kerr </i> focusses on the importance of this when writing about how the All Blacks form their team. They use the principle of “no dickheads”. No matter how good that single player might be, if they’re not good for the team then their individual performance is irrelevant. </p>
<p>I have lots more example of poor leadership, but I just want to touch on one final example in this blog post. This story is about a close friend of mine who works harder than anyone else I know. She’s devoted to her job and always puts in 100% regardless of how bad her day is. Even before she’s sat down at her desk most mornings she has people ambushing her with requests, both internally and externally. It reminds me a bit of The Devil Wears Prada, though in this case there are three or four devils – multiple demanding clients and multiple teams of internal support staff. Every day, this friend of mine goes to work and comes back home exhausted and with a new string of insults she’s been called during the day (and no she doesn’t work for the NHS). Every day, someone will shout at her at work, either down the phone or in person. Her boss sits opposite her. Her boss does nothing. When she’s shouted at or insulted from across the room, her boss looks at the floor and then when the bully has gone he looks at her with the look of “wow, they’re such dicks, I cant believe that happened again”.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Yeah, seriously.</p>
<p>So not only does he not stand-up and act when the situation is brought directly to him, but when my friend emails him and asks for help – saying she’s unhappy at work and puts to writing what she is dealing with – his response is usually “I know it is rubbish isn’t it, they’re all idiots”. This is not good enough. What’s his failure other than lack of courage? It’s a lack of accountability, it’s a lack of providing a safe and secure environment for his employee, it’s a lack of loyalty, it’s a lack of respect and it’s a lack of clear direction.</p>
<p>How would a good leader react differently? One, he will either directly address the bullying and harassment at the point of engagement, or he will talk to the bully’s superiors immediately to highlight the situation – this will show that he is not prepared to tolerate this behaviour and will fight for change. Two, he will tell my friend to report every situation where this happens in writing to him so that there is a record – this will give the impression that something is being done about it. Three, he will have a private meeting with my friend to talk about why she is unhappy, what processes can be put in place to ease the work load or take some of the stress away from the job. He will ask about her personal life in case there are other factors involved. He will provide clear direction on the tolerance of the company when it comes to bullying – either he is prepared to accept it because of the company culture (not good enough either, but whatever), or he’s disgusted and highlights the company policy on bullying and harassment. This is him taking accountability for the unhappiness of his employee and acknowledging responsibility to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>Without doing any of the above and burying his head in the sand, his employee is left feeling that maybe she is doing something wrong, or that she has to just accept it because that’s how every is expected to be treated there. Knocked confidence, knocked motivation, lower productivity, deeper hole, worse results, everyone’s fucked. Poor leadership has consequences.</p>
<p>As a Troop Commander in the Army and (hopefully) a future employer, I am expected to manage people. I hope that I can act on the lessons I have learned about how not to lead and can fill those positions as a leader rather than just as a manager. I truly believe that if you genuinely care about other people and give them your selfless commitment, people will follow you. It’s human nature to seek security and protection. Leaders must ensure that their followers believe they will provide this. It’s not good enough to turn your head and let it be someone else’s problem. Inaction is as bad as the wrong action. Leadership is behaviour, not position. </p>
